In particular, the tool detects individual accounts that begin to behave in a \r\nway distinct from accounts to which they had previously been similar. Each account is\r\nselected as a target account and is compared with all other accounts in the database, using\r\neither external comparison criteria or internal criteria summarizing earlier behaviour\r\npatterns of each account. Based on this comparison, a peer group of accounts most\r\nsimilar to the target account is chosen. The behaviour of the peer group is then\r\nsummarized at each subsequent time point, and the behaviour of the target account\r\ncompared with the summary of its peer group. Those target accounts exhibiting\r\nbehaviour most different from their peer group summary behaviour are flagged as\r\nmeriting closer investigation. \r\n\r\nAn example is provided below:\r\n\r\nA bunch of time series is generated. The unconditional mean is 0.\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<img src=\"fig1.png\" width=\"512\">\r\n</center>\r\n\r\nWe analyse the (normalised) time series in blue. At the beginning, it drops constantly before reverting back to the confidence intervals.\r\nThe score (shown in orange) is a t-statistics that summarises how far our time series is deviating from the equilibrium of the peer group.\r\nEach time, the series is deviating from the confidence intervals (e.g. 90%, 95%), the score sharply increases. We can then flag those objects\r\nwith scores that deviate most substantially as worth of closer investigation (e.g. fraud detection).\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<img src=\"fig2.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"512\">\r\n</center>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
